# Occluded-2D-pose-estimation-video-set
This repository includes mainly three video sequences with single person acting. Artificial occlusion patterns are added to occlude the upper body, lower body and mid-body of the acting person with black boxes in different severity levels. 2D Ground truth body annotations are given in text files for each sequence. Body annotations are in Openpose's 25 keypoint body format.
